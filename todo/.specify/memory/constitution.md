# Project Constitution: Evolution of Todo – Phase I

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Evolution of Todo – Phase I
**Phase:** In-Memory Python Console App
**Theme:** From CLI → Cloud-Native AI Systems
**Goal:** Build a console Todo app using Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code, following spec-driven development and clean architecture. Students act as Product Architects, avoiding boilerplate and focusing on intelligent system evolution.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
**Rule:** All development must follow the spec-driven development methodology using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.
**Rationale:** Ensures requirements are clearly defined before implementation, reducing rework and maintaining alignment between business needs and technical solutions.

### 2. Clean Architecture
**Rule:** The application must follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns.
**Rationale:** Maintains code quality, testability, and makes the system easier to understand, modify, and extend.

### 3. Functional Completeness
**Rule:** Must implement all basic features: Add Task (title, optional description), Delete Task (by ID), Update Task (title/description), View Task List (show ID, title, description, status), Mark Complete/Incomplete.
**Rationale:** Ensures the core functionality required for a usable todo application is delivered in this phase.

### 4. In-Memory Data Storage
**Rule:** All data must be stored in memory only, with no persistent storage in this phase.
**Rationale:** Simplifies initial implementation while focusing on core business logic and user interaction patterns.

### 5. Console-Based Interface
**Rule:** The application must be a console-based Python app with clear user interaction patterns.
**Rationale:** Provides a simple, accessible interface for demonstrating core functionality without UI complexity.

### 6. Proper Error Handling
**Rule:** All operations must include appropriate error handling and validation.
**Rationale:** Ensures robustness and provides clear feedback to users when operations fail.

### 7. Spec History Maintenance
**Rule:** All specification history must be maintained in the project's spec-history directory.
**Rationale:** Provides traceability and documentation of the project's evolution for future phases.

## Tech Stack Requirements

### 8. Python 3.13+
**Rule:** The application must be built using Python 3.13 or higher.
**Rationale:** Leverages modern Python features and ensures compatibility with current ecosystem.

### 9. UV Package Manager
**Rule:** Use UV for dependency management and virtual environment handling.
**Rationale:** Provides fast, reliable dependency management and modern Python tooling.

### 10. Claude Code Integration
**Rule:** Development must leverage Claude Code for all development tasks.
**Rationale:** Ensures consistent AI-assisted development practices and leverages intelligent code generation.

## Quality Standards

### 11. Clean Code
**Rule:** All code must follow clean code principles with proper naming, function size, and documentation.
**Rationale:** Maintains code quality and readability for current and future developers.

### 12. Structured Project Organization
**Rule:** The project must follow a structured organization with clear separation of concerns.
**Rationale:** Improves maintainability and makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

## Deliverables Commitment

### 13. Complete Documentation
**Rule:** Must deliver constitution file, specs-history/, /src Python source, README.md, and CLAUDE.md.
**Rationale:** Ensures complete project documentation and reproducibility.

### 14. Working CLI Application
**Rule:** Deliver a fully working CLI app demonstrating Add / List / Update / Delete / Toggle Complete.
**Rationale:** Validates that all core functionality works as expected and meets the project requirements.
